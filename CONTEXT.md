# True Count

True Count is a table-game practice and performance-tracking app for recreational players first and beginners second. Its games include blackjack, craps, and roulette.

## Language

**Table conditions**:
The rules and betting constraints governing a simulated game, used to determine which actions and strategy guidance apply.

**Rule preset**:
A named starting configuration of table conditions that a player can customize within the supported choices.

**Strategy**:
A system prescribing a player's actions or bets under particular game conditions. A strategy is the reference for coaching and adherence measurement.

**Guided practice**:
Simulated play against a selected strategy, with corrections offered before a deviating move is executed. The player can retry or explicitly override the correction.

**Blackjack training mode**:
A combination of the playing decisions being practiced and responsibility for maintaining the count. Basic and deviation practice can use app-supplied conditions, while counting modes require the player to maintain the count.

**Playing deviation**:
A prescribed departure from blackjack basic strategy when a specified condition is met. Following a selected deviation is strategy adherence, distinct from a player overriding coaching.

**Counting system**:
The card values and count calculations used to summarize exposed cards for blackjack practice. A counting system is distinct from the playing decisions or bet amounts selected using its count.

**Bet schedule**:
A rule mapping a blackjack count to a prescribed wager amount. Following the schedule is assessed separately from maintaining the count and choosing playing actions.

**Running count**:
The accumulated counting-system values of cards exposed during the current blackjack shoe. Concealed cards do not contribute until revealed.

**True count**:
The running count adjusted for the estimated decks remaining in the shoe using the selected conversion convention. It supplies conditions for playing deviations and bet schedules.

**Shoe penetration**:
The portion of a blackjack shoe dealt before the shuffle point is reached. A round already in progress finishes before the shuffle.

**Strategy cycle**:
A sequence of bets governed by a strategy's starting state and completion or termination rules. Restarting a cycle resets its strategy state without replenishing the session balance.

**Free play**:
Simulated table-game play without a required strategy to follow.

**Strategy adherence**:
How consistently a player follows the selected strategy, measured separately from financial results.

**Strategy override**:
A player's explicit choice to depart from the selected strategy's prescribed action or bet. It is distinct from following a playing deviation prescribed by that strategy.

**Strategy revision**:
A saved version of a strategy's instructions. A practice session follows one revision throughout, and its results retain that revision as their reference.

**Legal fallback**:
An alternative prescribed action when the preferred action is unavailable under the current table conditions or available balance.

**Pending strategy action**:
A prescribed action or adjustment waiting to execute, distinct from a game outcome that has already settled. Pausing the action does not reverse that outcome or its payout.

**Final settlement**:
The resolution of outstanding wagers after a strategy stops adding bets, with legally removable wagers returned.

**Practice session**:
A period of simulated play at one game, explicitly started and explicitly ended by stopping, resetting, or switching games. It has its own performance history, simulated balance, and deviation log.

**Casino session**:
A manually recorded period of real casino play at one game, bounded the same way as a practice session. It records a game, a date, one or more buy-ins, and a cash-out; table conditions and casino name are optional. It never carries a deviation log, since self-reported play cannot be verified against a strategy. Casino sessions are strictly private and never eligible for community or standardized-comparison features.

**Rebuy**:
An additional buy-in recorded within a session before its final cash-out. A session's net result sums all its buy-ins, including rebuys, against the one final cash-out.

**Visit**:
An automatic grouping of casino sessions that share the same casino name and date, used only to present a rolled-up view of a night's play. A visit has no identity, record, or fields of its own beyond that shared casino name and date.

**Deviation event**:
A single point during a practice session where the player's actual action differed from the strategy's prescribed action, recording whether the player retried into the correct action or explicitly overrode it (see Strategy override). Deviation events are logged individually as they occur and are never edited afterward. A session's deviation log is the ordered record of its deviation events; an empty log means the session was flawless.

**Bankroll**:
A tracked balance allocated to play, rather than money held or wagered by True Count. Simulated and real-play balances remain separate.

**Community strategy**:
A strategy submitted by an authenticated user with a profile for others to practice and rate. Its popularity and reported performance are distinct measures.

**Standardized simulation**:
An app-run evaluation of a strategy revision under defined comparison conditions. It supplies evidence for public performance comparisons, separate from community practice and self-reported casino results.

**Benchmark profile**:
A defined set of table conditions, starting bankroll, base betting unit, and session length used to compare strategy revisions through standardized simulation.

**Session drawdown**:
The fall from a session's previous balance peak, with outstanding stakes valued at their original amount until resolution. Maximum session drawdown is the largest such fall during the session, including final settlement.

**Strategy rating**:
A player's assessment of a community strategy's practice usefulness and clarity, tied to the revision they practiced. It is distinct from the strategy's financial performance.

**Strategy remix**:
A separately published strategy derived from another strategy revision, retaining attribution and a link to its source. It has its own ratings and performance evidence.

**Wager outcome**:
The win, loss, or push of an individual resolved wager, determined by its net result after applicable commissions. It is distinct from the combined result of simultaneous wagers or an entire session.

**Offline game selection**:
The single game a free account selects for offline play. Premium accounts can access all three launch games offline.

**Premium account**:
A subscription tier with full training access, all three launch games available offline, and no advertising.

**Counting challenge**:
A short, replayable exercise in card-value recognition, running counts, true-count conversion, or counting during simulated table play. Progress rewards accuracy before speed.

**Learn variant**:
A counting challenge that provides immediate explanations and retries. Its accuracy preserves the learner's first answer even after correction.

**Check variant**:
A counting challenge that withholds correctness feedback until the end, except for a reference count the learner explicitly chooses to reveal. Its results are kept separate from Learn results.

**Assisted attempt**:
A challenge attempt that provides learning aids revealing the answer, including a Check attempt in which the learner shows the reference running count. Hiding the aid again does not restore unassisted status.

**Observe table challenge**:
A counting challenge in which simulated players make the playing and betting decisions while the learner maintains the count.

**Play table challenge**:
A counting challenge in which the learner also makes playing decisions, with optional bet-schedule practice.

**Count checkpoint**:
A point in a counting challenge at which the learner submits a running count, true count, or both for assessment.

**Readiness milestone**:
An earned indication that a learner met the counting-accuracy standard for a particular challenge configuration. It supports a next-step recommendation without restricting access to other challenges.

**Training allowance**:
The daily amount of guided practice or counting challenges available to a free account. Guided-practice allowances may be measured by time, turns, or a training bankroll.

**Training bankroll**:
A daily simulated balance used to limit guided practice under a bankroll-based allowance. It is separate from saved practice and casino balances.
