# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

**Layout: single-context.** One `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root, with ADRs under `docs/adr/`.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root: the glossary of True Count's domain language (table conditions, rule presets, strategies, counting systems, training allowances, and so on).
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved. `docs/adr/` does not exist yet, and that's fine.

## File structure

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   ├── adr/                ← created lazily, when a decision is actually recorded
│   │   ├── 0001-....md
│   │   └── 0002-....md
│   └── agents/             ← this configuration
└── src/
```

If this repo ever splits into genuinely separate contexts, the multi-context layout is a root `CONTEXT-MAP.md` pointing at one `CONTEXT.md` per context, with context-scoped decisions in `src/<context>/docs/adr/` alongside system-wide ones in `docs/adr/`. Don't adopt that shape pre-emptively.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids — for example, `running count` and `true count` are distinct defined terms, as are the `Learn` and `Check` challenge variants.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
